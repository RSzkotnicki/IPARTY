Internet Party Line: Multi-person Audio Chat (IPARTY Version 1.2) By Intel 1995

<h2>This old software oddly still works well in all versions of windows including (windows 10, windows 11).
I was even able to host the daemon in amazon lightsail without any issues.</h2>

Internet Party Line (IPL) is a multi-party audio chat program designed to work over relatively low-bandwidth connections such as the Internet.  Instead of mixing audio from each participant in real-time, Internet Party Line queues statements and plays them one at a time.  This way, a group of people can audio chat without taking turns speaking.  It's something like using an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) style of conversation with audio instead of text.

Internet Party Line is implemented by two applications: IPARTY.EXE (the client) and IPARTYD.EXE (the server, or "deamon").  You may run just the client, or choose to also host Internet Party Line sessions by running the server as well.
